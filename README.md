# Summary

1. A Jupyter Notebook was created to develop Python code to scrape the multiple Mars data source websites and store the information in a NoSQL database (MongoDB).
2. This code was then consolidated into a single function `scrape()`.  The `scrape()` function was built into a Flask route `/scape`, which scaped the Mars data and updated the MongoDB.
3. The `/` (home) route in the Flask app retrieved the Mars information from the database and passed this as dictionary to the rendered home page `index.html`.
4. The home page used the dictionary to format the text and images into a new format.  The page included a button that would allow the user to perform another scrape of data as needed.
